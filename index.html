            <p>
               10 Cents is a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to donate money to nonprofit organizations on a recurring basis. Users can set up a subscription style payment plan of their choosing, or a Galileo card transaction roundup plan, both of which create a method for continued donations to charities. Transaction roundup is where a user connects their Galileo account to our platform and when they make a transaction, the amount of the transaction will be rounded up to the nearest dollar, and those extra few cents are donated to the charity of their choosing. The advantage of this style of payment is that the amount removed from a userâ€™s Galileo account is small enough that the user does not notice or care about donating just a couple of cents. And while the amount that is donated may seem small to a user, the many small amounts of donated spare change accumulate into an amount that makes a substantial difference for a good cause. 10 Cents tracks user donations over the course of a calendar year and provides donation statistics for the user to view at any time.
