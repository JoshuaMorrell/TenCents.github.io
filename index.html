            <p>
               10 Cents is a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to donate money to nonprofit organizations on a recurring basis. Users will set up a subscription style payment plan of their choosing, or a bank transaction roundup plan, both of which create a method for continued donations to charities. Transaction roundup is where a user connects their bank account to our platform and when they make a transaction, the amount of the transaction will be rounded up to the nearest dollar, and those extra few cents are donated to the charity of their choosing. The advantage of this style of payment is that the amount removed from a userâ€™s bank account is small enough that the user does not notice or care about donating just a couple of cents. And while the amount that is donated may seem small to a user, the many small amounts of donated spare change accumulate into an amount that makes a substantial difference for a good cause. 10 Cents tracks user donations over the course of a calendar year and provides donation statistics for the user to view at any time as well as a downloadable tax receipt for tax deductions. 
            </p>
            <p>
               We believe that 10 Cents could change the way people think about donating to a charitable cause. Most people hesitate when asked to donate even moderate sums of money to a good cause and will only donate on rare occasions. 10 Cents allows users to set up a plan to donate an almost insignificant amount of money on the occasion that they do make transactions, after which the app requires no further input. We are bringing the interaction of donating into the everyday lives of our users while giving them the motivation of a small tax break, helping those in need, and the realization that every little bit can make a difference.

                Josh had the responsibility of mobile development and used the Flutter SDK 
            to build the 10 Cents mobile app. This required work in configuring donations plans and setting
            up the front end to send and receive requests from the server.

                Tyrus worked on and built the backend of the application that handled transactions between users
            and charity accounts. He used Galileos API, and worked with them to get 10 Cent's transactions working.

                Ryan was in charge of the Django server development. This includes handling and processing requests that 
            will be sent by the mobile application, and sending out the requests for the app and galileo.
